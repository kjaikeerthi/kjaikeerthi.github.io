## The Problem

### Abundance of AI Hype, Scarcity of Practical Guidance
The tech landscape is flooded with AI marketing and theoretical content, but there's a significant gap in authentic, experience-based insights from practitioners who are building real products. Developers and entrepreneurs struggle to find trustworthy sources that share both successes and failures, practical implementation details, and honest assessments of tools and approaches.

**Our Solution:** A personal knowledge hub that authentically documents day-to-day work, thoughts, and learnings from building AI-first products, backed by 14+ years of product development experience and active work with LLMs, AI agents, and modern tech stacks.

## Differentiators

### Practitioner-First Perspective
Unlike generic tech blogs or marketing-heavy content sites, this platform shares genuine, unfiltered experiences from someone actively building production AI systems. Content focuses on real problems, real solutions, and honest assessments rather than hype.

### AI-First Development Focus
While many portfolios showcase past projects, this platform actively documents the journey of embracing AI-first development practices, providing readers with current, relevant insights into the rapidly evolving AI/LLM landscape.

### Curated Tool Recommendations
Instead of overwhelming visitors with every possible tool, the site shares a curated list of tools actually used in daily work, with context on why they're valuable. This helps developers and entrepreneurs cut through the noise.
